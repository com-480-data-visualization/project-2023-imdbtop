## Milestone 1 

### Dataset

####  1. Top250Movies

Benefits: This dataset has some basic information about IMDB Top 250 movies, including year, rating, directors, casts, box office, etc.

Drawbacks: 1) This dataset does not have movie id. If we want to get more information by web scrapper, we need movie_id. 2) Have some dirty data and requires data-preprocessing.

#### 2, IMDB Movies in different categories

Benefits: 1) A large number of movies. 2) In different categories. 3) Have movie_id, director_id, star_id

Drawbacks: Some movies in the Top 250 are not in this dataset, especially some non-English-speaking movies.

#### 3. Integrated Dataset

To overcome the drawbacks of the two datasets above, we merge a new dataset imdb250_merge_v1.0.csv. The integration methods are: 1) Use the script data_integration.py to join the two tables by movie_name, movie_year, and movie_rating. (220/250) movies are joined successfully. 2) Manually fill in the movie_id that is not joined successfully by script.

#### 4. We may use web scrapper to get more information in the future

As we got all the movie_ids of the top 250 movies using machine-based methods and manual methods, we may use web scraper to get more detailed information on moviews, like the movie country, director country, movie star country, etc.

### Problematic

#### 1. Overview:

Cinema has developed into one of the most popular entertainment genres in the world and an essential component of business and daily life since the 1960s and 1970s, when numerous Hollywood films started to prosper. It's become more and more difficult to decide which movie to see since several movie websites have classified innumerable movies as "must-sees," "classics," or more and more film reviewers have remarked on these movies in lengthy, thorough reviews. In this project, our goals were to create a visual movie search website and to be able to draw useful conclusions and recommandations about movies from the results.

#### 2. Motivation & Target audience:

Since our intention is to recommend quality films, we have chosen the IMDB top 250 films data. There are more commercial films and platforms available today than ever before. Many individuals who are interested in movies or just want to locate a movie to watch to pass the time may find it challenging to choose from the huge amount of selections in today's world of information explosion. Our objective is to offer a simple, user-friendly movie search platform together with a suggestion feature that enables those who want to see high-caliber films but find it difficult to make a decision based just on plot summaries or user reviews.

As everyone's favorite films have different directions, our search system will give users a large degree of freedom to search. For example, search by country of directors or actors/actress, search by genre, search by IMDB rating score, search by box office or profitability of a film, etc. Furthermore, we want to give a visual recommendation page so that users can choose the recommended movies more intuitively.

### Related work

There has been a lot of data analysis and visualization done on IMDB datasets. The work includes:
* [Recommendation System](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anmolbajpai/imdb-movies-analysis-eda-recommendations#RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM): This project explains content-based filtering, and uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) with cosine similarity to recommend movies.
* [Rating visualization](https://krisrs1128.github.io/stat679_notes/2022/06/01/week2-3.html): This project uses Shiny to explore the IMDB movie dataset. They use filters to show the rating score by different genres, MPAA ratings, and periods.

Also, some visualizations from other fields inspired us to try to improve our website:
* [Interactive maps](https://maphub.net/hyperknot/custom-markers-berlin-zoo): We think we can make an interactive world map with directors and actors/actresses from all over the world. 
* [Word Cloud](https://earthlinginteractive.com/blog/book-and-movie-word-clouds/): This is a book word cloud, which is a very good way to visualize different categories. In our project, we want to create an interactive word cloud with genres of movies, and you can click your favorite genre to check what are the best movies in this genre with synopses of these movies.
* [Visualized recommendation network](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221514932_Integrating_statistics_and_visualization_Case_studies_of_gaining_clarity_during_exploratory_data_analysis): This thesis introduces the notion of visualizing the suggestion process using a recommendation network. That is a better method to illustrate the connection between the movies that were recommended and the ones you searched for.

We found a website called [Suggest Me Movie](https://www.suggestmemovie.com/) which is a very convenient website that can recommend you some movies with the filters you choose to apply. However, we found the interface for selecting filters on this site to be very pale and uninteresting (check some movie categories or select a movie language and rating). IMDB also has a recommendation system, but it is simply a list of movies that may interest users. Our idea is to visualize the process of adding filters to the search. For example, we can use an iteractive map that gives people the freedom to choose actors and directors for films in different countries or regions. Also we can use a word cloud to show the percentage of films in the IMDB top 250 by genres, and you can select the terms (film categories) to be used as filters in the search. For the recommandation part, we wanted to present the recommended films in a more visual way using a network of relationships.
